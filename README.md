PhpMyAdmin is an open source tool where you can administer your MariaDB database(s). It is pre-installed with your web hosting subscription. In phpMyAdmin you can, import, export, optimize or drop tables.

If your website is using a database, this is where all the data of your site is stored. For example, WordPress stores all your posts, comments and articles in a database.
